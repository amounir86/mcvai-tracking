<h1>Pulldown Removal with 32-bit videoIO on Windows </h1>
<p><i>by Gerald Dalley<br>
April 2008</i></p>This document describes how to recover the original progressive 24fps frames from 
certain types of 60 field-per-second videos using the 32-bit videoIO toolbox
for Matlab on Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p align="center">

<h2>Background</h2>

<div class="quick">We assume that the reader is already familiar with the the basic concepts
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlace">interlacing</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecine">pulldown</a>.  </div>


As of early 2008, most consumer-grade high-definition camcorders use a mode 
called "24PF", "PF24", "24F", "24PsF", or a few other names.  These modes 
exist for some legacy reasons and are not really 
the same thing as a true 24p recording (despite what the marketing materials
suggest).  For this discussion, we will focus on the 24pf mode of the 
Canon HG10 camcorder.  

<p>For this camcorder, (a) whole 1920x0180 progressive video frames are captured 
at 24 
frames per second, then they are (b) scaled down to 1440x1080, (c) broken 
up into fields, (d) processed with 2-3 pulldown, and (e) encoded using
an AVCHD codec.  This means the video is stored as if it were 60 
fields-per-second, interlaced (60i) using a somewhat new and very complex 
encoding.  

<p>If one were to simply decode this video 
and use it as-is, 3 out of every 5 frames would have interlacing artifacts
in them and the comb artifacts for these frames will be roughly twice as 
bad as they would be had the video been captured as true 60i.  When 
processing videos in Matlab, one often would much prefer recovering the
original 24p frames.

<p>To recover the original progressive frames, one must perform something 
called "pulldown removal", "reverse pulldown", "inverse pulldown", 
"inverse telecine", or "ivtc".&nbsp; Unfortunately, this is not a trivial task.

<p>In this document we describe the easiest robust solution we have found
for pulldown removal.&nbsp; The specific details may need to be adjusted for the 
user's videos that are not obtained from a Canon HG10 or similar camcorder.&nbsp; 
This method will only work on Windows with 32-bit applications (unless 
you can find or build 64-bit ports of AviSynth, DeComb, and FDecimate).  
Feel free to experiment and to tweak the instructions to try using ffdshow 
for decoding instead of CoreAVC.</p>

<h2><a name="required"></a>Required Software</h2>

<ul>
<li>Download and install <a href="http://www.avisynth.org/">AviSynth</a> 2.5 or 
later.&nbsp; We will use the AviSynth system via ffdshow to do the pulldown removal.

<li>Download <a href="http://neuron2.net/decomb/decombnew.html">DeComb for 
  AviSynth</a> and place the files in your AviSynth plugins directory 
  ("<a href="file:///C:/Program%20Files/AviSynth%202.5/plugins%22%20or%20similar"><tt>C:\Program Files\AviSynth 2.5\plugins</tt>" or similar</a>).&nbsp; DeComb will be 
  used to reconstruct progressive frames.

<li>Download <a href="http://neuron2.net/fdecimate/fdecimate.html">FDecimate for AviSynth</a>
  and place the files in your AviSynth plugins directory.&nbsp; FDecimate will be used to eliminate
  duplicate frames.

<li>Download and install the 
  <a href="http://www.softella.com/dsfm/index.en.htm">DirectShow Filter Manager</a>.  
  This is a nice GUI tool for configuring defaults for DirectShow filters.  

<li>Download and install <a href="http://blog.monogram.sk/janos/tools/monogram-graphstudio/">MONOGRAM GraphStudio</a>.  
	This serves as an enhanced version of Microsoft's GraphEdit application.  
    It's useful for building, configuring, and testing DirectShow filtergraphs.  GraphEdit may be used instead.

<li>Download and install 
  <a href="http://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/">ffdshow-tryout(s)</a>.  
  You'll want the most recent version possible.&nbsp; We will need it for 
  pulldown removal, even if the ffdshow video decoder does not work.&nbsp; When running
  the installer, make sure you do a custom install and verify that ffdshow's AviSynth plugin 
is installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
<ul>
<li><i>Clarification note: </i>ffdshow is a collection of DirectShow filters for 
processing and decoding audio and video.&nbsp; There is an ffdshow plugin that 
allows it to embed AviSynth.&nbsp; FDecimate and DeComb are plugins for 
AviSynth.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<li>Purchase the <a href="www.corecodec.com">CoreAVC Professional decoder</a>.  
  We  have found it to be the most robust codec available as of early 2008.  
  Make sure you install the Haali Media Splitter if given the choice.&nbsp; If you 
  do not want to spend the $15 right now, install the 
  <a href="http://haali.cs.msu.ru/mkv/">Haali splitter</a> separately
  and adjust the instructions below to use the "<tt>ffdshow Video Decoder</tt>" 
  instead of the "<tt>CoreAVC Video Decoder</tt>".&nbsp; Also, if you are 
decoding MPEG-2 DV-based video instead of AVCHD, you do not need CoreAVC.</ul>

<h2>Basic Filter Configuration</h2>

We need to make sure that the filters we have just installed are the defaults.  
Launch the <a href="http://www.softella.com/dsfm/index.en.htm">DirectShow Filter Manager</a>:<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/dsfm.png"></p>

<h3>Haali Media Splitter Merit</h3>
<p>Find the "<tt>Haali Media Splitter</tt>".  Double-click on it to launch the 
     filter properties.&nbsp; If the "<tt>Filter merit</tt>" is below <tt>0x00800001</tt>, then
     change it to that value and click the "<tt>Set new merit</tt>" button.
     
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/haali.png"><p>Close the dialog.
     
<p>The Haali splitter is the only one we know that
     handles transport streams correctly (ArcSoft, CyberLink, and most 
     others incorrectly report the AVCHD video stream as MPEG2).
     
<h3>CoreAVC Configuration</h3>
<p>Open the filter properties of the "<tt>CoreAVC Video Decoder</tt>".&nbsp; Press 
     the "<tt>Filter settings</tt>" button.&nbsp; Place <tt>YUY2</tt> as the preferred output 
     format (move that one to the top of the list).&nbsp; The DeComb AviSynth 
filter requires either YUY2 or YV12
     and YUY2 is higher-quality.&nbsp; Change the deinterlacing setting to "<tt>None (Weave)</tt>".&nbsp; If the deinterlacer is not disabled, it will destroy some of the information we wish
     to recover.&nbsp;  Check "<tt>Crop 1088 to 1080</tt>".&nbsp; AVCHD videos must have a height that is
     evenly divisible by 16, so 1080 videos are padded to 1088.&nbsp; This 
checkbox reverses the padding.&nbsp; Check 
     "<tt>Preferred decoder</tt>".  
     
     
     <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/coreavcconfig.png" width="707" height="612"><p>When you dismiss the settings dialog, verify
     that the filter merit is greater than <tt>0x00800000</tt>.&nbsp;
     
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/coreavcmerit.png" width="596" height="326"><p>These changes
     will make CoreAVC the default and have it output non-deinterlaced
     frames.
     
<h3>ffdshow Video Decoder Merit</h3>
<p>Change the "<tt>ffdshow Video Decoder</tt>"'s merit to something below
     <tt>0x00800000</tt> (<tt>0x00600000</tt> is a good value).&nbsp; We need 
     to make sure that the CoreAVC decoder gets chosen instead of ffdshow.&nbsp; 
If you want to test ffdshow, just set its merit to be larger than CoreAVC's.
     
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/ffdshowmerit.png" width="596" height="326">

<h3>ffdshow raw video filter Merit</h3>
<p>Change the "<tt>ffdshow raw video filter</tt>"'s merit (<b>not</b> the &quot;<tt>ffdshow Video 
Decoder</tt>&quot;'s) to a value larger
     than <tt>0x00800001</tt>.&nbsp; We used <tt>0xFFFF0000</tt>.
     
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/ffdshowrvfmerit.png" width="596" height="326"><p>This will cause the ffdshow 
     filter to be automatically inserted whenever a "<tt>Video Renderer</tt>" is 
     used, such as when troubleshooting in GraphStudio.  
     
     <p>If you are using
     ffdshow for decoding instead of CoreAVC, make sure the raw filter's merit 
     is <tt>0</tt> so it will never be automatically instantiated.  The ffdshow decoder will 
     already perform the filtering and we don't want to filter the video 
     twice.
     
<h3>Reboot</h3>
<p>Sometimes the filter merit settings do not take effect 
     without a reboot.


<h2>ffdshow Configuration</h2>

We will now configure the "<tt>ffdshow raw video filter</tt>" to do 
the pulldown removal for Canon HG10 videos.&nbsp; If you are using the 
"<tt>ffdshow Video Decoder</tt>" for decoding instead of CoreAVC, 
make the changes to that filter instead of the raw video filter.

<h3>Creating a Profile</h3>

<p>In the DirectShow Filter Manager, open the filter settings dialog
for the "<tt>ffdshow raw video filter</tt>".&nbsp; We will be creating a 
new preset for these videos so that other videos that use ffdshow 
will not be affected.

<ol>
<li>Select the "<tt>Profiles / Preset settings</tt>" in the leftmost listbox.
<li>On the right, press the "<tt>New</tt>" button to create a new profile.  
<li>Press the "<tt>Rename</tt>" button and choose the name "<tt>hg10pf24coreavc</tt>" 
or some other descriptive name. 
<li>Make sure "<b><tt>default</tt></b>" is still bold.  
If it isn't, double click on "<b><tt>default</tt></b>" to make it really be the 
default, then click on "<tt>hg10pf24coreavc</tt>&quot; again so the remaining 
modifications will apply to our new profile. 
<li>Check the "<tt>Automatic preset loading</tt>" checkbox. 
<li>Check the "<tt>Try to load preset from file first</tt>" checkbox.
</ol>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/ffdprofile.png" width="587" height="513"></p>

<h3>
Autoload Configuration</h3>
<p>
Press the "<tt>Preset autoload conditions...</tt>" button.&nbsp; Here we will 
set some heuristics to let the filter know on which videos it should apply the pulldown 
removal.&nbsp; Adjust these as appropriate for your videos.<ol>
<li>Select the "<tt>On all conditions match (AND)</tt>" radio button.
<li>Check the "<tt>on movie dimensions match</tt>" checkbox.
<li>Put <tt>1440</tt> as the minimum and maximum width.
<li>Put <tt>1080</tt> as the minimum height.
<li>Put <tt>1088</tt> as the maximum height.
<li>Check the "<tt>on a DirectShow filter presence</tt>" checkbox and add 
     "<tt>Core AVC Video Decoder</tt>" to its textbox.&nbsp; This is a trick to avoid processing 
     30pf MPEG2 streams that do not need pulldown removal (because 30pf decodes 
the same as true 30p).
<li>Check the "<tt>on frame rate match</tt>" checkbox and add
     "<tt>fps>=29.9 AND fps<=30</tt>" to its textbox.  24pf will be reported as 30p.&nbsp; 
If you have AVCHD 30p or 30pf content, you may need to figure out some 
additional heuristics.</ol>
     
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/ffdauto.png" width="283" height="535"><h3>
Resize &amp; aspect</h3>
<p>The combination of CoreAVC and ffdshow often result in the video being 
rescaled and letterboxed if care is not taken.&nbsp; We can prevent the resizing 
from happening by forcing the size to be what we want (1440x1080).&nbsp; </p>
<p>On the right pane in the top left corner, make sure that &quot;<tt>hg10pf24coreavc</tt>&quot; 
is selected (instead of &quot;<tt>default</tt>&quot; or some other profile).&nbsp; </p>
<ol>
	<li>On the 
left treeview, check the &quot;<tt>Resize &amp; aspect</tt>&quot; entry.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 
right again, 
	<ol>
		<li>check the &quot;<tt>Resize</tt>&quot;&nbsp; checkbox, </li>
		<li>select the &quot;<tt>Specify 
horizontal and vertical size</tt>&quot; radio button, </li>
		<li>type &quot;<tt>1440</tt>&quot; 
x &quot;<tt>1080</tt>&quot; in the &quot;<tt>New Size</tt>&quot; area, and </li>
		<li>choose &quot;<tt>4</tt>&quot;:&quot;<tt>3</tt>&quot; 
as the aspect ratio.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>On the rightmost inner panel, 
	<ol>
		<li>choose the &quot;<tt>Resize 
always</tt>&quot; radio button, </li>
		<li>check the &quot;<tt>Process pixel aspect ratio 
internally</tt>&quot; checkbox, and </li>
		<li>enter &quot;<tt>4</tt>&quot; x &quot;<tt>3</tt>&quot; 
as the &quot;<tt>PAR of output device</tt>&quot;.&nbsp; </li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>In the lower panel, choose &quot;<tt>No 
aspect ratio correction</tt>&quot;.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>The properties box should look like this:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/ffdresize.png" width="587" height="513"></p>
<p>Our white treeview on the left of the dialog is likely simpler than yours 
since we removed most of the filters using the &quot;<tt>Show / hide filters</tt>&quot; 
option.&nbsp; This is purely a personal preference (unless you wish to use those 
filters).</p>
<h3>Pulldown Removal via AviSynth</h3>
<p>We are now finally ready to configure the pulldown removal.&nbsp; We assume 
that the AviSynth and the DeComb and FDecimate filters have been
<a href="#required">installed as previously described</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<ol>
	<li>On the right pane in the top left corner, make sure that &quot;<tt>hg10pf24coreavc</tt>&quot; 
is selected (instead of &quot;<tt>default</tt>&quot; or some other profile).&nbsp; 
	</li>
	<li>On the 
left treeview, check the &quot;<tt>AviSynth</tt>&quot; entry.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>On the right 
again, check all of the checkboxes that are not already checked:<ol>
		<li>&quot;<tt>AviSynth</tt>&quot;,</li>
		<li>&quot;<tt>Add 
ffdshow video source</tt>&quot;,</li>
		<li>all of the input colorspaces (or at least <tt>YUY2</tt>), 
and </li>
		<li>&quot;<tt>Buffer back/ahead</tt>&quot;.&nbsp; </li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Set the buffer values to &quot;<tt>8</tt>&quot; 
and &quot;<tt>8</tt>&quot;.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>The large textbox is a space for AviSynth scripts.&nbsp; 
Enter the following script (it's okay to remove the comments):</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
	<pre class="comment"># Tell AviSynth it's a 30fps source.  It doesn't matter if it's </pre>
	<pre class="comment"># really an NTSC 29.97fps source.  The rates are only used </pre>
	<pre class="comment"># internally.</pre>
	<pre>AssumeFPS(30) </pre>
	<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
	<pre class="comment"># Assume that the top field is first (bottom first is very rare)</pre>
	<pre>AssumeTFF()</pre>
	<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
	<pre class="comment"># Use the DeComb filter without extra postprocessing in 2-3</pre>
	<pre class="comment"># pulldown reversal mode.  This will reconstruct 30fps progressive</pre>
	<pre class="comment"># frames.  For clean sources, every 5th frame will be a duplicate.</pre>
	<pre>Telecide(guide=1,post=0)</pre>
	<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
	<pre class="comment"># Drop the duplicate frames.  For clean sources, every 5th frame</pre>
	<pre class="comment"># will be dropped because 30/(30-24)=5.</pre>
	<pre>FDecimate(rate=24,show=false)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The dialog should now look like this (shown with the script comments removed):</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/ffdivtc.png" width="587" height="513"></p>
<p>Feel free to explore the rest of the ffdshow options as desired.&nbsp; Note 
that turning on the onscreen display (&quot;<tt>OSD</tt>&quot; in the left white 
treeview) can sometimes confuse for the DeComb filter.</p>
<h2>GraphStudio Testing</h2>
<p>Before testing videoIO, it is useful to test the configuration with 
GraphStudio.&nbsp; Launch GraphStudio and load the <tt>tests/hg10-pf24-clip2.mts</tt> clip.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/filtergraph.png" width="672" height="355"></p>
<p>If you are using CoreAVC, make sure that that filter is instantiated as well 
as the &quot;<tt>ffdshow raw video filter</tt>&quot;.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If instead you are using the 
&quot;<tt>ffdshow Video Filter</tt>&quot;, make sure that the raw filter is not
also instantiated.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Press the play and/or single step buttons to view the 
results.&nbsp; You should see a clean video without any comb artifacts like 
those in the image at the very top of this article.</p>
<h2>videoIO Testing</h2>
<p>Launch Matlab and try running the following code:</p>
<blockquote>
	<pre class="comment">% The file of interest is in the tests/ directory</pre>
	<pre>cd(fullfile(videoIODir, 'tests'));</pre>
	<pre>file     = 'hg10-pf24-clip2.mts';</pre>
	<pre class="comment">% Here's an early frame that shows combing </pre>
	<pre>frameNum = 125;</pre>
	<pre class="comment">&nbsp;</pre>
	<pre class="comment">% Original video without pulldown removal</pre>
	<pre>vrOrig   = videoReader(file, 'preciseFrames',-1);</pre>
	<pre class="comment">% With pulldown removal </pre>
	<pre>vrIvtc   = videoReader(file, 'preciseFrames',-1, ...</pre>
	<pre>                       'dfilters','ffdshow raw video filter');</pre>
	<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
	<pre class="comment">% show the frame of interest in the original video</pre>
	<pre>seek(vrOrig, frameNum)</pre>
	<pre>figure(1); imshow(getframe(vrOrig)); title('with combing');</pre>
	<pre class="comment">&nbsp;</pre>
	<pre class="comment">% show the equivalent frame after removal (w/ framerate conversion)</pre>
	<pre>seek(vrIvtc, frameNum*4/5)</pre>
	<pre>figure(2); imshow(getframe(vrIvtc)); title('pulldown removed');</pre>
	<pre class="comment">&nbsp;</pre>
	<pre class="comment">% cleanup</pre>
	<pre>vrOrig = close(vrOrig);</pre>
	<pre>vrIvtc = close(vrIvtc);</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>There should be a very obvious difference between the two figures when 
looking at the gray car.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Note that with version 1.6.2.5 of CoreAVC, <tt>'preciseFrames',-1</tt>
must be used in the <tt>videoReader</tt> constructor because seeking is partially broken.&nbsp; The CoreAVC team is 
working on fixing this issue, so future versions are likely to work.</p>

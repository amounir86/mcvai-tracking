=======================================================================
  videoIO 0.7 (beta 5)  [ongoing changes]  
=======================================================================
* API Changes
  -- GETINFO has been renamed to GET.  This new method allows the user 
     to extract a single field (e.g. get(vr,'fps')).  Also, all field 
     aliases and extra info that were previously available via DISP 
     and DISPLAY are now available through GET too.  GETINFO has been
     deprecated.  For now GETINFO, it calls GET and issues a warning.

  -- codecs = videoWriter([], pluginName, 'codecs') is now
     codecs = videoWriter([], 'codecs', pluginName).  This allows our
     internal code to be more consistent.

* New plugins
  -- Added videoReader_matrix plugin for "reading" in-memory 3D or 4D 
     matrices as videos.  The plugin also will load a whole video from 
     a single .mat file.

  -- Added videoReader_concat plugin for stringing together video 
     clips as if they were a single long video.

  -- The old videoWriter_DirectShow has been renamed to be 
     videoWriter_Vfw since it actually used the Video for Windows API 
     for most of its body instead of DirectShow.  A new 
     videoWriter_DirectShow plugin that really uses DirectShow has
     been created.

* New features
  -- The videoReader DirectShow plugin now allows insertion of 
     DirectShow postprocessing filters.  This is useful for tasks
     such as pulldown removal.
     
* Robustness improvements for tests
  -- doPreciseSeekTests is more tolerant of low-quality
     decompressors.
     
  -- extractFrames does a better job detecting whether it's been run
     previously.
     
  -- DirectShowIVideo does a better job handling DirectShow objects 
     with video duration off-by-one internal inconsistencies.  This 
     mostly affects Windows XP users trying to read uncompressed 
     videos.
     
* Documentation updates and improvements
  -- Adjustments to INSTALL.ffmpeg.txt corresponding to changes in 
     ffmpeg's configure options.
    
  -- Plugin-specific parameters for the videoReader and videoWriter 
     constructors are now documented in the plugin's M-file.  This 
     helps cut down much of the bulk in videoReader.m's and 
     videoWriter.m's help sections.

  -- Miscellaneous tweaks to the introductory documentation.

  -- Added an auto-generated Contents.m file.  videoIoSysInfo now 
     extracts version info from it.

* Usability improvements
  -- Constructors now auto-convert slashs and backslashes to the 
     correct one for the current platform.
     
  -- imread and load plugins:

     -- They now support seeking before the beginning.  This 
        important to simulate resets by seeking to -1.
     
     -- They now return an empty matrix upon calling getframe on 
        a nonexistent frame.  This makes it more consistent with  
        the C++ plugins that support dropped frames.  This also  
        allows users to check the return value instead of requiring  
        a try-catch block if they wish to silently ignore dropped  
        frames.

  -- The DirectShow videoReader plugin construction is now 
     case-insensitive for optional argument names.

  -- The NEXT, SEEK, and STEP methods of videoReader now return 
     logical values instead of integer values.  This allows them to be
     used directly in Matlab ASSERT statements directly
     (e.g. "assert(next(vr))") instead of requiring the explicit
     typecast (e.g. "assert(logical(next(vr)))").

  -- The DirectShow, Vfw, and ffmpeg videoWriter plugins now use the 
     first frame given to ADDFRAME to choose the video size if the 
     width and height are not explicitly given in the constructor 
     call.
     
  -- VfwOVideo now only obtains a write lock instead of a full
     exclusive lock on the output file.  This allows players like VLC 
     to peek at the output while it's being written.  
	 
  -- DirectShow videoWriter plugin:

     -- It now tries harder to grab focus for the compression dialog 
        (beforehand, it was easy for the dialog to appear, but remain 
        hidden behind the Matlab window).

     -- The most recently used codec is stored in the Windows registry
        so that it becomes the default codec (unless a default is
        explicitly given in the registry as well).

  -- FfmpegIVideo now allows (by default) ignoring undecodable 
     packets.  This allows it to read some corrupted video files
     (and is how ffmpeg.c and ffplay.c currently work).
     
  -- readTests now issues warnings instead of errors when 
     doPreciseSeekTests fail.  This is because some versions of 
     Windows XP fail to support precise seeks even when constant 
     bitrate videos are processed.

  -- The GET method for videoWriter objects now returns a
     currFrameNumber field for the DirectShow, Vfw, and ffmpeg
     plugins.

  -- On non-Windows platforms, username expansion now works for
     filenames starting with the '~' character.

  -- The DirectShow videoReader plugin now has better handling for
     files where the duration is reported incorrectly.

* Bug fixes / compatibility improvements
  -- Tweaked ffmpeg-config-internal.pl to suppress spurious error 
     messages when examinining Debian Sarge's libavcodec.
     
  -- Fixed missing calls to CoInitialize in the DirectShow and Vfw 
     plugins.

  -- Handles symlink-ed matlab executables on Linux now.

  -- Makefile allows the user to override the compiler by setting the
     CXX environment variable.

* Miscellaneous changes
  -- All constructor parsers now strictly check to make sure that no
     unrecognized parameter names are used.

  -- The windowsBin packages now contain the Windows source and not
     just the binaries.

  -- Much higher default bitrate for the ffmpeg videoWriter plugins.
     The default bitrate also adapts to the current frame size.

  -- Windows binary packages now omit the source files and 
     buildVideo* files so that the tests will not try to invoke a 
     build.  INSTALL.dshow.txt is more explicit about the difference
     between the different packages.

=======================================================================
  videoIO 0.6 (beta 4)  [r533]  23 Feb 2008
=======================================================================
Notable changes: (a) mixed 32-bit/64-bit support on Linux, 
(b) much more powerful videoWriter/addframe, (c) disp and display 
methods.

 * Mixed-mode support: 32-bit ffmpeg and/or 32-bit Matlab on 64-bit
   Linux is now supported.  See INSTALL.ffmpeg.txt and/or makefile 
   for details.
 * videoReader and videoWriter key-value constructor parameters are 
   now case-insensitive w.r.t. the keys (e.g. 'bitrate' now works as 
   well as 'bitRate' now).

 * videoWriter/addframe enhancements
   -- On Matlab 2007a and later, the lanczos3 method of IMRESIZE is 
      used when resizing is necessary, for higher-quality results.
   -- A significant number of enhancements have been made to mirror the
      functionality of avifile/addframe.  Multiple frames may be given,
      MOV structures may be given, and figure handles may be given.  If
      a figure handle is given, an offscreen rendering of the figure is
      used to generate the frame.   An extensive set of examples is now
      present in tests/addFrameDemo.m.

 * Windows (DirectShow) plugin changes
   -- Made the per-frame seek timeout user-configable for the 
      videoReader DirectShow plugin.  Look for frameTimeoutMS in 
      videoReader's help docs.
   -- INSTALL.dshow.html replaces INSTALL.dshow.txt.  The new one uses
      DHTML to simplify instructions given user input.

 * GNU/Linux (ffmpeg) plugin changes
   -- Default plugins: On GNU/Linux, if the ffmpegPopen2 plugins are 
      not found, but ffmpegDirect plugins are found, then the 
      ffmpegDirect plugins will be used by default.
   -- Fixed an overflow error that prevented the number of frames from 
      being calculated properly on GNU/Linux for long videos.

 * Miscellaneous
   -- Added disp and display method overrides.
   -- More documentation improvements based on new features, changes 
      made, and user feedback.  
   -- Added a general mechanism for passing back arbitrary string data 
      for the getinfo metho that's plugin-specific.

=======================================================================
  videoIO 0.5 (beta 3)  [r472]  14 Jan 2008
=======================================================================
 * Full 64-bit support
   -- 64-bit Windows and Linux are now officially supported.  
   -- We attempt to automatically detect when the user has forgotten 
      to build the mex functions and/or has built them for different 
      platforms.
   -- Unofficially, some users have been able to use 32-bit ffmpeg 
      and/or 32-bit Matlab on 64-bit Linux.  
   -- Created videoIoSysInfo.m to gather system information.  This 
      may help diagnose 32-bit/64-bit compatibility problems (e.g. 
      when not all of the following are 64-bit: the operating system, 
      Matlab, and ffmpeg).

 * imread and load plugins for videoReader added
   -- Allow easy reading of videos stored as individual frames on disk.
   -- Does not require any compilation (implemented with pure .m 
      files).

 * M-file API
   -- Added unofficial "approxFrameNum" field to the struct returned 
      by videoReader's getinfo method.

 * DirectShow videoReader plugin
   -- Allows user to control when to use precise vs. imprecise seeking.

 * ffmpeg videoReader plugins
   -- More accurate seeking in most cases.
   -- More robust library detection.

 * Miscellaneous
   -- Made the main codebase compatible with Matlab 6.5 again.
   -- More robust tests.
   -- Documentation improvements.
      -- General modifications/improvements.
      -- Several new FAQ items based on user feedback.
   -- More descriptive error messages for some common confusing cases.
   -- Various bug fixes / stability improvements / usability 
      enhancements.
   -- Some refactoring to consolidate "private" code.  pvtVideoIO_* 
      and private/ contain these private functions.
   -- Various tweaks to the sourceforge packaging.

=======================================================================
  videoIO 0.4 (beta 2)  [r417]  3 Aug 2007
=======================================================================
Added support for 64-bit Windows running 32-bit or 64-bit Matlab. 
Right now, only Video for Windows (VFW) encoders are supported, but
the ffdshow-tryout project here on sf.net provides a massive set of
64-bit VFW codecs.

=======================================================================
  videoIO 0.3 (beta 1)  [r397]  6 Jun 2007
=======================================================================
This version has been cleaned up. The project and toolbox name was 
changed from videoReader to videoIO to reflect the fact that we can 
now read and write video files. 

The *-notest* files on SourceForge have no test scripts and no test 
videos in them. We recommmend that most users download a larger 
package that has the tests. They can be used to make sure the library 
is working and they give examples of how to use the library. 

The *-source* files contain all of the source code and no binary mex 
files. GNU/Linux users must use one of these. 

The *-win32bin* files are stripped down to remove all unnecessary 
source code and provide 32-bit Windows mex files created on Windows 
XP for Matlab 2006a. Users who do not want to install the DirectShow 
SDK may want to use one of these files instead of a *-source* file.

=======================================================================
  videoReader 0.2  4 June 2007
=======================================================================
Can read and write videos now.
Windows: DirectShow backend.
GNU/Linux: ffmpeg backend only (avifile support removed).

=======================================================================
  videoReader 0.1  6 Nov 2006
=======================================================================
Original release. 
Only supports reading videos. 
Windows: DirectShow backend 
GNU/Linux: ffmpeg and avifile backends

In this section we will discuss the main module of the project which is the tracker. A simple Kalman filter tracker has been provided in the tracking framework. It uses results of the representer to track the position and the extent of the object being tracked. The Kalman filter works by estimating an unobservable state which is updated in time with a linear state update and additive Gaussian noise. It uses the technique described in \cite{Arulampalam01atutorial}.

\section{Segmentation}
The process of segmentation is to separate the background to foreground.

\begin{itemize}
\item The Background subtraction use three parameters: \textbf{gamma},\textbf{tau} and \textbf{radius}.
	$ Background_{i+1} = gamma*frame_{i} + (1-gamma)*Background_{i}$
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Gamma is the learning rate, usually is 0,05.
	\item Tau is the different between frame to background.
	\item Radius is the parameter to delete the little blobs.
	\end{itemize}
	
\item The \textit{background subtraction} is not robustness to change illumination, for this we implement \textit{Grey-World} because is invariant to illuminant changes. 
The Grey-World method try to eliminate the gray in the image, for this reason move the minimum and the maximum values.

\begin{equation}
	( R' G' B' )= \left(
	\begin{array}{ccc}
		\frac{R_{grey}}{R_{m}(I)}  0  0 \\
		0  \frac{G_{grey}}{G_{m}(I)}  0 \\
 		0  0  \frac{B_{grey}}{B_{m}(I)}
	\end{array}
	\right) 
	* 
	\left(
	\begin{array}{c} R \\ G \\ B
	\end{array}
	\right)
\end{equation} 

\item Selectivity is the other method that use the simple different between foreground with background but the selectivity a prior knows that pixel is or isn't foreground. 

\item Eigenbackground
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

Tracking of visual phenomena is a very hard and frustrating task. It depends on many parameters that are very hard to be managed or correctly handled. The background subtractor is hardly going to be perfect. The lighting conditions and the quality of the camera play an important role. The detector especially when detecting specific thing like a face can hardly be robust. Also when attempting to recognize and depend on classification then the problem becomes more and more complex. According to these problems associating the measurements with the object being tracked can still be very hectic. Finally, all of these factors affect the tracker making the tracking problem very hard.
